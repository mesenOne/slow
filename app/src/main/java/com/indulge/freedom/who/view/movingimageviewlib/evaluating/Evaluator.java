/**
 * An evaluator handles generating values basing on some sort of logic (e.g. Time, Scroll, Gyroscope...).
 * <p/>
 * It has got its own lifecycle:
 * <p/>
 * - onCreate()
 * <p/>
 * - onUpdate()
 * <p/>
 * - onPause()
 * <p/>
 * - onDestroy()
 * <p/>
 * The foreground lifetime starts in the onCreate() method and ends in the onDestroy() one
 * During its foreground lifetime an Evaluator generates values. Call the view.invalidate() method to update the view when any changing value event occurs.
 * To generate values it uses the evaluate methods. These methods are called when the view is invalidated, so don't call them.
 * <p/>
